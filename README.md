# Karabiner

[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) is an app for MacOS that enables sophisticated keyboard mapping.

You can do simple keyboard remapping in the GUI, but conditional mapping and other more powerful features require handcrafting a JSON file.

This module manages that configuration.
